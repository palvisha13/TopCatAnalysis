------------------------------------

"Data cleaning and Analysis using Python and TOPCAT" focuses on data cleaning and the basic analysis of astronomical data accquired through TOPCAT.
The information provided below will discuss TOPCAT, the installation process, and how to search for data from various astronomical surveys on TOPCAT, as well as retrieving the data for analysis. 


# What is TOPCAT?

TOPCAT stands for Tool for Operations on Catalogues  and Tables, and is an interactive software equipped with various facilities to visualize astronomical data. 
It is particularly useful in managing large sets of tabular data. 

A more detailed list of features and their functions can be found at this [link](http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/#features).

# TOPCAT Installation
 
  
   ### For MacOS 
  > For Apple Mac users, the installation file can be downloaded at: <a href="http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/topcat-full.dmg">MacOS X TOPCAT</a> 
  ### For Non-MacOS 
  
  > Download one of two `.jar` files: 
  
  >[topcat_full_.jar]()
  
  >[topcat_lite.jar]()
  
  > **Unix based systems:** 
  
  >> run the command `chmod +x topcat` in the same directory the `.jar` file is downloaded to. 
  
  >> run the command `topcat`
  
  >**Non-Unix systems:**
  
  >> run the command `chmod +x topcat`
  
  >> run the command `java -jar topcat-*.jar`.
